monte carlo methods:
	measuring the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of
	inferential statistics

a random sample tends to exhibit the same properties of the population from
which it is drawn

it is not sufficient to produce a good answer.  we have to have a valid reason
to be believe it's a good answer.

Before we can believe in the results of a simulation:
	1) Conceptual Model is coorect
	2) Implementation is correct
	3) Large enough sample

Confidence Intervals:
	for normal distributions
	instead of estimating an unknown parameter by a single value (the mean of a
	set of trials), a cofidence interval provides a range that is likely to
	contain the unknown value and a confidence level that the unknown value
	lays within that range

Empirical Rule
	68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
	95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
	99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

Stanard Error
	Provides an estimate of the standard deviation
