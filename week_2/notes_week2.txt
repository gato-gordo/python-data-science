Law of Large Numbers:
	in repeated independent tests with the same actual probability p of a
	particular outcome in each test, the chance that the fraction of times that
	outcome differs from p converges to 0 as the number of trials goes to
	infinity
	-- says nothing about absolute difference

Gambler's Fallacy:
	if deviations from the expected behavior occur, those deviations are likely
	to be evened out by opposite deviations in the future
	--Why? independent events

Linear Scaling:
	-- points evenly laid out

-Never possible to be assured of perfect accuracy through sampling, unless you
sample the entire population

How Much is Enough?
-how many samples do we need to look at in order to have a justified confidence
that something that is true about the population of samples is also true about
the population from which the samples are drawn?

Depends on the Variance in the underlying distribution
	- variance - how much spread there is in different outcomes

Standard of Deviation
	- how many values are close to the mean

The standard of deviation should always be viewed in the contxt of of the mean.
If the mean were a billion and the standard deviation were 100, we would view
the dispersion of the data as small.  If the mean were 100 and the standard
deviation 100, we would view the dispersion as quite large.

The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean.
  *** when comparing data sets with highly variables means, the
  coefficient of variation is often more informative than the standard deviation
