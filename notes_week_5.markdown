Optimization Problems
====================

An optimization problem generally has two parts:

* An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized.
	- For example, find the route that has the cheapest airfare between Boston
	  and Istanbul.
* A set of constraints (possibly empty) that must be honored
	- For example, don't exceed an upper bound on the travel time, or on the
	  number of legs in the trip

Valuable to know about these kinds of problems, as can use **problem reduction**
to reduce a new problem to a variant of a known problem type for which others
have created efficient solutions.
